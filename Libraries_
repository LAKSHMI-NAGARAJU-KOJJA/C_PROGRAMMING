Certainly! Here are GitHub links to Arduino libraries for the sensors you've mentioned:

1. Soil Moisture Sensor:

RAK12035 Soil Moisture Sensor Library: This library provides an interface to communicate with the RAK12035 Soil Moisture sensor over I2C. 



2. PIR Motion Sensor:

PIR Sensor Library: This library supports monitoring up to 8 PIR sensors simultaneously. 



3. General Sensor Support:

Adafruit Sensor Library: A common sensor library that provides unified sensor interfaces.

Arduino Sensor Kit Library: Provides support for various sensors in the Arduino Sensor Kit.




For sensors like LDR (Light Dependent Resistor), IR (Infrared) Sensor, Ultrasonic Sensor, and Sound Sensor, dedicated libraries might not be necessary, as they can be interfaced directly using Arduino's built-in functions. However, if you're looking for additional functionalities or simplified interfaces, you might find relevant libraries in the Arduino Library List or the Arduino Sensors Library Category.

To install these libraries, you can download them from the provided GitHub links and add them to your Arduino IDE. Alternatively, you can use the Arduino Library Manager by searching for the library names.

If you need further assistance with specific sensors or libraries, feel free to ask!
